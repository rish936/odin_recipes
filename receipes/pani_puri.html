    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Making Pani Puri Stuffing</h3></li>
        </ul>
        
        <li>Boil the potatoes till they are cooked completely.</li>
        <li>Peel them and then chop them.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the onion if using it.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the potatoes, onions, coriander leaves, cumin powder, chaat masala powder and black salt or regular salt. Mix well and keep aside.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Making Pani (Spiced Water)</h3></li>
        </ul>
        <li>In a blender add all the ingredients mentioned above for the pani.</li>
        <li>Add water and grind to a fine chutney.</li>
        <li>Remove the green chutney in a large bowl. Rinse the mixer jar with ½ cup water first and then add this water in the bowl. Then add ½ to ¾ cup more water.</li>
        <li>Mix well. Check the seasoning. Add more salt or jeera powder or chaat masala or jaggery if required. If you want a thin pani, you could add some water. But keep on checking the seasoning, as per your taste.</li>
        <li>Add the boondi to the pani.</li>
        <li>You can chill the pani in the fridge or add some ice cubes to it.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Assembling Pani Puri</h3></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Crack the top of the puri with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Add 2 to 3 teaspoons of the boiled potato-onion filling in the poori.</li>
        <li>Stir the green pani first and then add it in the poori. Optionally you can add some sweet chutney in the puri. </li>
        <li>Serve the pani puri immediately otherwise the prepared puri with stuffing and water will become soggy.</li>
        <li>You can also make individual portions with the puris, potato-onion mixture and the pani. Let the individual assemble the pani puri for himself/herself as per his/her taste.</li>
    </ol>
