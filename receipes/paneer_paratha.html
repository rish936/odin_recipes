        <li>2 to 2.25 cups whole wheat flour - 240 grams to 270 grams</li>
        <li>⅔ cup water or add as required</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Ghee or oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt or add as required</li>
        <li><h3>For Paneer Paratha Stuffing</h3></li>
        <li>200 grams Paneer (Indian cottage cheese)</li>
        <li>1 or 2 green chilies - finely chopped or ½ to 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Garam Masala</li>
        <li>½ to ¾ teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder) or add as per your taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt or add as required</li>
        <li>Ghee or oil as required for roasting parathas</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Kneading Dough</h3></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Take whole wheat flour, salt, ghee or oil in a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour ½ cup water first.</li>
        <li>Mix and begin to knead. Add more water if required and knead to a smooth soft dough. Overall I added ⅔ cup water.</li>
        <li>Cover and allow the dough to rest for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Making Paneer Stuffing</h3></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Meanwhile while the dough is resting, prepare the stuffing. Grate the paneer.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped green chilies, dry mango powder, punjabi garam masala or garam masala powder, red chili powder and salt. </li>
        <li>You can add more of the salt, red chili powder or dry mango powder if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Mix everything well so that the spice powders are evenly mixed with the grated paneer.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Rolling Paneer Paratha</h3></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Pinch two small balls from the dough and roll them in your palms to make them even.</li>
        <li>Dust some flour on the dough balls.</li>
        <li>With a rolling pin, roll the dough balls to a circle of about 4 to 5 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Place the paneer stuffing on one of the rolled rounds keeping one inch space around the circumference.</li>
        <li>Cover with the other rolled dough and press the edges well.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some flour and roll the stuffed paratha to a circle of about 6 to 7 inches in diameter.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Making Paneer Paratha</h3></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Heat a tava or griddle and then place the rolled paratha on it. The tava should be hot. To check the heat, sprinkle a generous pinch of whole wheat flour on the tawa. If the whole wheat flour becomes brown in some seconds, the tawa is hot enough to roast the parathas.</li>
        <li>Flip when one side is partly cooked. About ¼ cooked.</li>
        <li>Apply ghee on this side with a spoon. Turn over and flip when the second side is half cooked.</li>
        <li>Let the ghee side get cooked now. Spread some ghee on the top. Flip again using a spatula.</li>
        <li>Press the paratha edges with a spatula so that the edges are cooked.</li>
        <li>Flip once or twice till the paratha has golden spots and is evenly cooked.</li>
        <li>Place them in a roti basket or casserole.</li>
        <li>Optionally you can place some butter on top and spread it with a spoon.¼</li>
        <li>Wipe the excess whole wheat flour if any, with a cotton kitchen napkin. So that the browned whole wheat flour does not stick to the parathas. </li>
        <li>Make all paratha this way on the tawa (griddle).</li>
        <li>Keep on stacking them in the roti basket or casserole. Spread some butter on each paratha while stacking them.</li>
        <li>If not stacking them, then serve paneer paratha hot with some fresh yogurt or pickle and butter. A cup of hot ginger tea will also go very well.</li>
    </ol>
